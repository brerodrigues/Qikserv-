   - *Response:* 
     In the past 12 months, I encountered a significant business-related decision during our migration from a monolithic architecture to microservices. Specifically, my involvement centered on the authentication aspect, where we opted to integrate Keycloak into our system.

   The situation demanded careful consideration as authentication is a critical component affecting both user experience and system security. We faced multiple alternatives, including building our own authentication service from scratch, leveraging third-party solutions like Auth0, or integrating an open-source solution like Keycloak.
   
   After thorough analysis and discussions, we concluded that Keycloak offered the best balance of features, customization options, and scalability for our needs. While building our own solution could provide full control, it would require extensive development time and ongoing maintenance. Third-party solutions offered convenience but lacked the flexibility to tailor authentication flows to our specific requirements.
   
   By choosing Keycloak, we could leverage its robust authentication and authorization capabilities while also benefiting from its active community support and continuous updates. Additionally, its seamless integration with our microservices architecture streamlined the migration process and minimized disruptions to existing functionalities.
   
   Overall, this judgment call prioritized efficiency, security, and long-term scalability, aligning with our business goals of modernizing our infrastructure while maintaining a secure and user-friendly environment.
