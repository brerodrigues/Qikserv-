## Thought Process

- **Document Review:** I began by thoroughly reviewing the document outlining the project requirements. I made a concerted effort to carefully note down the steps necessary to develop the solution.

- **Research:** I conducted research on similar applications and solutions to analyze existing implementations. This helped me gain insights into best practices and possible approaches to address the project's requirements.

- **Technology Selection:** After gathering information, I made preliminary decisions on the libraries and technologies that would be used to kickstart the development process. These decisions were not final but provided a starting point for the project.

- **Data Structuring:** I initiated the development process by analyzing and determining how the data would be structured, based on the responses from the mock API. 

- **API Communication:** I developed the communication process with the mock API, aiming to keep it flexible to accommodate the potential need for other APIs in the future. 

- **Testing:** I tested my code to ensure it effectively communicated with the API and correctly consumed data. Additionally, I ensured that it could handle exceptions gracefully, implementing error-handling mechanisms.

- **Shopping Cart Logic:** I created the logic for adding products to a shopping cart.

- **Promotions Implementation:** I researched and devised the best approach to implement promotions, aiming to streamline the development process and facilitate the integration of new types of promotions into the system.

- **Integration:** I integrated the promotions logic into the shopping cart logic and developed the calculation logic for determining final values. This step ensured that the system accurately applied promotions and calculated prices correctly.
